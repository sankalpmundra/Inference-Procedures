    "Researchers suspect that _myopia_, or nearsightedness, is becoming more common over time. A study from the year 2000 showed 132 cases of this condition in 400 randomly selected people. A separate study from 2015 showed 228 cases in 600 randomly selected people. Based on these samples, is there support for the researchers' belief that _myopia_ is becoming more common amongst people? Provide statistical evidence to support your answer, using a significance level of 5% in your significance test."

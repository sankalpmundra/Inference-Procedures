    "Some boxes of a certain brand of breakfast cereal include a voucher for a free video rental inside the box. The company that makes the cereal claims that a voucher can be found in 20 percent of the boxes. However based, on their experiences eating this cereal at home, a group of students believe that the true proportion of boxes with vouchers is less than 20%. This group of students purchased 65 boxes of the cereal to investigate the company's claim. The students found a total of 11 vouchers for free video rentals in the 65 purchased boxes.\n",

    "Suppose it is reasonable to assume that the 65 boxes purchased by the students are a random sample of all the boxes of this cereal. Based on this sample, is there support for the students' belief that the proportion of boxes with vouchers is truly less than 20%? Provide statistical evidence to support your answer, using a significance level of 5% in your significance test."
